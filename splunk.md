## Welcome

Good morning everyone, I hope you are doing well after this sunny weekend! I'm Dominic and I am a Penetrationtester and also responsible for IT Security in a small-ish startup.

I heard you want to learn how to use splunk. Great! In my opinion you learn it best in a hands on execise with the BOTSv3 Dataset. BOTS = Boss of the SOC (Security Operations Center).

I have setup a BOTSv3 envrioment here: <http://3.67.98.121:8000/> user: powercoders, passwort: $H0l1d41s$.

To get a initial overview of splunk, please watch the following video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWl-TuAAF-k&list=PL7zWAA-DF0k_sxswRiB7_GUTyI0FoV7lc&index=2>.

I will give you the questions in a shortwhile (once I found out how to feasibly export an csv file to a pdf :slightly_smiling_face:). Anyhow I believe this course is entirely possible in a self learning envrioment.

Use youtube and google to your advantace. There are also many solutions for the questions out there so you can find out how exactly it has been solved. One of which is this: <https://ellisstannard.medium.com/boss-of-the-socs-bots-v3-part-1-3a0d92b851b4>. But try to solve it yourself first and if you cannot find a solution only then look it up online.

Also find attached a Quick Reference Handbook for splunk. When I first learned splunk this Pdf was my best friend.

On a sidenote: If someone of you wants to go into the field of Penetration Testing and wants to do some work related to this instead of splunk (which is only SOC) please reach out to me. :slightly_smiling_face: Happy Logging.
